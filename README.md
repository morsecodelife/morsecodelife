## About
I’m Morse, a full-stack developer who enjoys working across both software and hardware. On the web side, I build applications with modern stacks, while on the hardware side I’ve explored microcontrollers, IoT, and communication protocols. I’m also fascinated by deep learning and computer vision, and I like experimenting with ways to bring those techniques into real-world projects.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find experiments, side projects, and learning notes that reflect my curiosity across these areas.
